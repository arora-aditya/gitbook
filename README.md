# LeetCode!

Since early 2017 I have been doing [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/submissions/#/46) problems in my free time, whenever and wherever.

Not only does this ensure that my algorithmic knowledge is in tip top shape it also makes sure that my brain keeps exercising. \(It is a muscle ya'll\)

I've done quite a lot of these problems here, but am trying to catch up on writing out my approaches one by one. It'll take some time but I hope to get it done soon!

If you want to see my solutions in their raw formats head to my [github repo](https://github.com/arora-aditya/competitive-programming/tree/master/leetcode)
