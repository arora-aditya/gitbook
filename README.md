# LeetCode!

Since early 2017 I have been doing [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/submissions/#/46) problems in my free time, whenever and wherever.

Not only does this ensure that my algorithmic knowledge is in tip top shape it also makes sure that my brain keeps exercising. \(It is a muscle ya'll\)

If you're seeing this right now, then hold up, the real stuff will be populated over the next few days! Each solution will hopefully be painfully documented with the thinking coming through at each stage...

If you want to see my solutions in their raw formats head to my [github repo](https://github.com/arora-aditya/competitive-programming/tree/master/leetcode)
